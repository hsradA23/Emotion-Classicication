# Emotion Detection using BERT
This repository contains the application that is the frontend that allows users to talk into the mic.

# Features
- Converts voice input into text using speech recognition.
- Analyzes the text using natural language processing techniques.
- Determines the emotional state of the user based on the analyzed text.
- Supports multiple languages for voice recognition and emotion detection.
- Provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users.

# Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Start speaking into the microphone or provide an audio file as input.
3. The system will convert your speech into text.
4. The text will be analyzed using natural language processing techniques.
5. The system will then detect the emotion based on the analyzed text.
6. The detected emotion will be displayed on the screen or provided as output.


# Acknowledgments
- The speech recognition component of this project is built using the SpeechRecognition library.
- The emotion detection component utilizes BERT trained on emotion-labeled text data.
